Welcome to the SpeechAIExperiments repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and understanding the capabilities of OpenAI's APIs. Through a series of Python scripts, about various aspects of AI-driven interactions, including chatbots, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and more, leveraging the power of OpenAI.

## Content
The repository contains several Python scripts that serve as practical examples of how to integrate and use OpenAI's APIs for different purposes:

- chat_AIs.py: Implements a basic chat AI using OpenAI's GPT model.
- chatlog.jsonl: Stores logs from chat interactions with the AI.
- record_speech.py: Captures speech input for processing.
- telegram_openAI.py: Integrates OpenAI's API with Telegram for an interactive chatbot experience.
