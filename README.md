# SpeechAIExperiments

Welcome to the SpeechAIExperiments repository. 

This project is dedicated to exploring some capabilities of OpenAI's APIs. Through a series of Python scripts, we delve into various aspects of AI-driven interactions, including chatbots, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and more, leveraging the power of OpenAI.

The primary goal was to create, within a couple of days, a working Telegram chatbot capable of sending voice notes (speech-to-text) to an instance of ChatGPT and receiving a reply in the same format (text-to-speech). 
Another secondary objective was to have a Python script running in the background to activate and communicate with ChatGPT hands-free, solely using voice input.

## Contents
The repository contains several Python scripts that serve as practical examples of how to integrate and use OpenAI's APIs for different purposes:

- `chat_AIs.py`: Implements a basic chat AI using OpenAI's GPT model.
- `chatlog.jsonl`: Stores logs from chat interactions with the AI.
- `record_speech.py`: Captures speech input for processing.
- `telegram_openAI.py`: Integrates OpenAI's API with Telegram for an interactive chatbot experience.
- `text_speech.py`: Converts text input into speech.
- `wav_to_mp3_to_wav.py`: Demonstrates audio format conversion.
